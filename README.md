### Hi there 👋

- 🖧 I am currently working for Cisco as a frontend software engineer
- 🖋️ At work, I’m developing the unified [Webex Whiteboard](https://whiteboard.webex.com/) alongside a fantastic team
- 🔑 Outside of work, I'm currently working on a contribution to [GoSimpleLLC/nbvcxz](https://github.com/GoSimpleLLC/nbvcxz)
- 🃏 The side project that I'm most proud of developing is [Riffle](https://github.com/Ronan-H/riffle), a web based multiplayer card game
- 👀 I'm always on the lookout for any exciting frontend or full stack roles!
